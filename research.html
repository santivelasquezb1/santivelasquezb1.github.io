    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">Quantitative analysis of labor production functions and input substitutability requires high-quality data on labor productivity, which can be challenging to obtain. Professional sports matches offer an ideal setting for this analysis due to the abundance, frequency, and quality of data typically collected. I analyze labor substitutability using data from the top 5 most competitive men’s soccer leagues in Europe. By focusing on unpredictable injuries, I apply event study methods to assess the impact of these exogenous shocks on the performance of the injured player and their team. The results indicate that injuries have both long- and medium-term effects on the injured player’s performance. Additionally, the impact of a player’s performance on their teammates varies based on the player’s and team’s characteristics, with higher-performing players having a more significant effect on lower-performing teams. </div></p>

	<button class="accordion">  Abstract	</button>
	<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We propose a simultaneous three-part model to examine the impact of marijuana legalization on cocaine demand in Colombia. Modeling the demand for these drugs simultaneously proves important due to an underlying unobserved correlation. Our results indicate that the likelihood of cocaine use is higher among men in their 20s, particularly those from higher socioeconomic backgrounds and with lower levels of education. On average, marijuana legalization is linked to a 2.6% increase in the probability of cocaine use. This increase is slightly more significant among women than men, with rates of 3% and 2.5%, respectively. </div></p>

The Story Continues in Colombia: An Endogenous Three-part Model</a> with <a href="https://www.eafit.edu.co/docentes-investigadores/Paginas/andres-ramirez.aspx"><em class="italic-text-2">Andrés Ramírez-Hassan</em></a> <br>
    <button class="accordion">  Abstract	</button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug, and understanding its demand is important for analyzing the potential effects of legalization. This paper presents an endogenous three-part model that considers incidental truncation and access restrictions to study marijuana demand in Colombia and assess the potential impact of legalization. Our findings suggest that modeling access, intensive, and extensive margins together is crucial, and that selection into access significantly affects the intensive margin. We observe that young men who have used alcohol and cigarettes, live in neighborhoods with drug suppliers, and have friends who use marijuana are more likely to have access to and use the drug. Additionally, we find that marijuana has an inelastic demand, with an elasticity of -0.45. Our results are consistent across various specifications and definitions. If marijuana were legalized, younger individuals with a medium or low perception of risk associated with its use would increase their probability of consumption by 3.8 percentage points, from 13.6% to 17.4%. Overall, legalization would raise the probability of consumption by 0.7 percentage points, from 2.3% to 3.0%. Depending on different price scenarios, annual tax revenues could range from USD 11.0 million to USD 54.2 million, with a potential benchmark of USD 32 million. </div></p>
