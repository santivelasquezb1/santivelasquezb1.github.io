    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">Quantitative analysis of labor production functions requires high-quality and longitudinal data on labor productivity, which is unlikely to be available. I study labor substitutability using the information on the top 5 most competitive men's football leagues in Europe. By considering individual player productivity to be the in-game performance statistics and focusing only on unpredictable injuries, I use event study approaches to causally estimate the effect of the negative exogenous shock on the injured players and their team's productivity. I further extend the analysis to understand what type of players serve as substitutes or complements. The findings suggest that injuries have long and medium-term effects on the injured player's performance. The extent to which a player's performance affects their teammates is determined by both the player's and his team's performance—specifically, high-performing players playing in an underperforming team function as complements by substantially positively influencing their teammates.</div></p>

	<button class="accordion">  Abstract	</button>
	<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We propose a simultaneous three-part model to examine the impact of marijuana legalization on cocaine demand in Colombia. Modeling the demand for these drugs simultaneously proves important due to an underlying unobserved correlation. Our results indicate that the likelihood of cocaine use is higher among men in their 20s, particularly those from higher socioeconomic backgrounds and with lower levels of education. On average, marijuana legalization is linked to a 2.6% increase in the probability of cocaine use. This increase is slightly more significant among women than men, with rates of 3% and 2.5%, respectively. </div></p>

    <button class="accordion">  Abstract	</button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug, and understanding its demand is important for analyzing the potential effects of legalization. This paper presents an endogenous three-part model that considers incidental truncation and access restrictions to study marijuana demand in Colombia and assess the potential impact of legalization. Our findings suggest that modeling access, intensive, and extensive margins together is crucial, and that selection into access significantly affects the intensive margin. We observe that young men who have used alcohol and cigarettes, live in neighborhoods with drug suppliers, and have friends who use marijuana are more likely to have access to and use the drug. Additionally, we find that marijuana has an inelastic demand, with an elasticity of -0.45. Our results are consistent across various specifications and definitions. If marijuana were legalized, younger individuals with a medium or low perception of risk associated with its use would increase their probability of consumption by 3.8 percentage points, from 13.6% to 17.4%. Overall, legalization would raise the probability of consumption by 0.7 percentage points, from 2.3% to 3.0%. Depending on different price scenarios, annual tax revenues could range from USD 11.0 million to USD 54.2 million, with a potential benchmark of USD 32 million. </div></p>
